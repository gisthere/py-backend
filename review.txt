1. There is a Python convention to write class names starting with capital letter (PEP8 ?)
2. Class detailed descriptions are missing.
3. Classes are poorly structured with little sense - mix of not relevant functionality.
4. Lots of important cases are not handled.
5. Prints are not good for production code. Proper logging is missing
6. Inappropriate data structures in most of the cases
7. Poor code quality
8. Overall task is not done, because your implementation looks like emulation, not like a real working system
